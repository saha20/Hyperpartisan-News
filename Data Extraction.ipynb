      "text  :  briefly in our opinion full 150 of the regular full position speculative short positions in gold silver and mining stocks are justified from the risk reward perspective at the moment of publishing this alert gold moved back and forth on friday and the accompanying volume was high but that s not the only important thing that we can discuss today the week is over and we have weekly changes and weekly volume levels to analyze and we saw major moves in the important ratios additionally we discovered a self similar pattern in gold that has critical and volatile implications going forward let s start with friday s session and the changes in the gold market chart courtesy of gold moved sharply back and forth as both positive and negative data was released and ultimately it ended the session a few dollars higher based on kitco s prices the closing price was 1 279 60 why was the reaction so significant the reason could be technical the apex of the triangle was likely to be accompanied by a turnaround and since we just saw a more visible top a couple of days ago and apparently gold doesn t want to form a bottom here then the only remaining outcome is a local daily top that doesn t change much which is what we saw why do we think that gold doesn t want to bottom here because if it did it would have ended friday s session much higher if gold doesn t want to move higher then silver must really hate that thought the white metal declined once again and even though gold closed a bit higher it managed to close lower the move lower by itself is already bearish as it took place on visible volume but it s very bearish once we take into account thursday s breakdown we previously commented on it in the following way silver declined and it reversed before the end of the session which appears to be a reversal but does this reversal really have bullish implications it doesn t seem to be the case the volume wasn t huge enough to confirm the reversal and it was not low enough to invalidate the bearish implications of the decline either the key thing to the proper analysis of the silver price swing is the awareness of what the usd and s amp p 500 did the former declined a bit while stocks truly soared which created perfect circumstances for a silver rally yet instead of a rally we saw a decline and a move below the rising support line based on the august and october lows consequently silver s action was very bearish as it showed great weakness in this market moreover the mentioned support line could be viewed as a neck level of a head and shoulders pattern with a rather long right shoulder similar to the one that we saw in the euro which serves as an additional bearish indication it s only a small addition to the bearish implications of the breakdown as such as its implications are bearish regardless of the h amp s formation being in place or not on friday the general stock market declined significantly but almost the entire decline was reversed before the end of the session if we consider thursday and friday together the s amp p 500 index still rallied considerably but silver declined and was unable to invalidate its breakdown the implications are strongly bearish let s move back to gold for a few minutes in terms of the euro the bearish signals are much more profound gold has just broken below the rising medium term support line and the most recent local top was formed approximately at the apex of the triangle pattern in terms of time the latter makes it considerably more likely that an important top was just formed and thus that the breakdown that we just saw will be confirmed as far as the apex of the triangle is concerned it s actually a combination of two such patterns they are based on the same tops and bottoms but in one case red lines they are based on the intraday extremes and in the other case black lines they are based on the daily closing prices the most recent top took place right between the apexes created based on both patterns the mentioned breakdown is almost confirmed almost because we would prefer to see three consecutive closing prices below the support line to see it as strong resistance but we have already seen two of them a weekly close and also a failed attempt to move back above the line the breakdown is very close to being fully confirmed and the bearishness of the implications increased significantly based on friday s session speaking of breakdowns we saw one in the gold to s amp p 500 ratio which is nothing new but still quite exciting and important why because due to several failed attempts to break below this level we had to be skeptical toward the breakdown this time the question was would this time be any different it turned out that this time was different as the ratio moved back to the previously broken level verified it as support and then continued to move lower on huge volume precisely the ratio itself doesn t have volume so what we mean is the ratio of volumes why would the above be a big deal because this ratio moves in tune with gold when it comes to major price moves and more importantly there was only one similar case in the past 15 years when we saw a similar breakdown and it was in the early stages of the 2012 2013 decline back then it was a warning sign that practically nobody noticed you ll probably not see it anywhere except for this publication this time either naturally the implications are strongly bearish as the breakdown now appears believable from the weekly point of view we see that mining stocks declined and broke below the rising support lines based on the 2016 and 2017 lows and that the breakdown took place on big volume all that happened after two weeks of low volume upswings that we commented on in finally the weekly volume levels in the gdx etf paint a very bearish picture for the following weeks the gdx etf is after 2 small weekly rallies that were accompanied by very low volume when compared with the previous weeks the last week had less trading days but that doesn t explain the previous week s low volume reading moreover we didn t see similarly low volume readings in the past novembers which suggests that we are correct to view the low volume levels as something important and meaningful the only comparable situation from the recent past took place in mid 2014 marked with a black arrow in the following weeks the gdx price was cut by a third the bearish implications of the above just became more bearish as back in 2014 the first big volume weekly decline meant that the big slide had just begun the breakdown can also be seen in the case of the hui to s amp p 500 index ratio in other words by looking at all in all the medium term outlook is clearly bearish based on the above and based on the factors that we discussed previously and it seems that we ve been correct to be holding the short positions in metals and miners especially in silver and miners still it seems that the vast majority of the potential that these positions have is still to be realized this is particularly the case given the similarities between what we re seeing now and what we saw before the previous slides we already discussed some of those similarities above but there s also something else that is likely in play right now in early october we described the analogy in performance between 2008 and the current period at the moment in gold stocks it was almost two months ago so even if you read it at that time it might be worth however today we are not going to repeat the october analysis we are going to discuss something alike in gold that s right the gold market features similarities to its performance back in 2008 before moving to details let s state that the analogy is far from perfect that s probably why we didn t discover it earlier however it s not the point to be picky about a technique but rather to see if there is anything that it can give us and make us particularly aware of things that could come with regard to the latter goal in mind it seems that we have something very valuable in both cases we have a sharp rally that preceded a top then we saw some kind of consolidation and another attempt to move higher which failed mid 2008 and second half of 2012 and started a decline the decline was more or less twice the size of the decline from the key march 2008 and late 2011 top in 2008 we saw a corrective upswing that was followed by a move to almost the final bottom and from mid 2013 to early 2015 we saw several such corrective upswings after the initial bottom september 2008 and the final part of 2015 gold soared sharply the sizes of the upswings differ on a relative basis but it s understandable as back in 2008 the moves took place in a very short time so the levels of emotionality among market participants were much higher after the sharp rally gold consolidated a bit late september 2008 and mid 2016 then declined and moved close to the previous highs once again october 2008 and september 2017 the decline that started thereafter in 2008 was the biggest and sharpest decline in many years naturally this does not bode well for the near term gold outlook conversely it seems that we can expect the most important part of the decline to be just around the corner the above implication is not the only interesting thing about the analogy though the detail that could be important going forward is the moment when the decline took a breather at this time the moves take more time so the pauses could be longer and more visible as well and if we get enough bullish confirmations once gold moves to certain price levels we might even adjust the trading position temporarily in 2008 the first interim pause was at the most recent important low and the second pause was approximately the level from which the sharpest part of the previous huge rally started which was strengthened by another support level the previous low we don t have price levels that would be 100 analogous but we can see which levels are most similar in our view the most recent important lows would be close to the 1 200 level march may and july 2017 bottoms and the next strong support will be provided by the 1 120 1 130 area that s approximately from where gold soared most sharply in early 2016 and this level is strengthened by the december 2016 low these levels are most likely to generate support strong enough to trigger at least corrective rallies based on the analogy to what we saw in 2008 and based on their own strength as support naturally that s what appears likely based on the data that we have today and the likely scenario could change as new developments unfold there s one more thing that we left for the analytical dessert namely back in 2008 the previous key low september 2008 low which is analogous to the late 2015 bottom didn t trigger even a small rally consequently even though a bottom or at least a correction will be widely expected once gold moves below 1 100 gold may continue to move lower and slide through 1 050 like a hot knife through butter finally there s one more thing that makes the current situation in gold similar to 2008 the overall increase in the volume levels we already discussed why yes the volume has been growing almost constantly but the 2008 and 2017 buildups in volume still stand out the growth is much sharper than in other years and no other period is comparable to those years since the 2008 volume buildup was followed by a sharp decline in the precious metals sector it seems that we might see something similar also this and or the next year summing up there are multiple bearish signals in the gold market and in the rest of the precious metals sector and the analogies to previous major declines further support the bearish outlook the big decline in pms appears to be underway as the previously discussed long term signals remain in place to summarize trading capital supplementary part of the in case one wants to bet on junior mining stocks prices we do not suggest doing so we think senior mining stocks are more predictable in the case of short term trades if one wants to do it anyway we provide the details here are the stop loss details and exit prices long term capital core part of the insurance capital core part of the whether you already subscribed or not we encourage you to find out please note that the in the trading section we describe the situation for the day that the alert is posted in other words it we are writing about a speculative position it means that it is up to date on the day it was posted we are also featuring the initial target prices so that you can decide whether keeping a position on a given day is something that is in tune with your approach some moves are too small for medium term traders and some might appear too big for day traders plus you might want to read please note that a full position doesn t mean using all of the capital for a given trade you will find details on our thoughts on as a reminder initial target price means exactly that an initial one it s not a price level at which we suggest closing positions if this becomes the case like it did in the previous trade we will refer to these levels as levels of exit orders exactly as we ve done previously stop loss levels however are naturally not initial but something that in our opinion might be entered as an order since it is impossible to synchronize target prices and stop loss levels for all the etfs and etns with the main markets that we provide these levels for gold silver and mining stocks the gdx etf the stop loss levels and target prices for other etns and etf among other ugld dgld uslv dslv nugt dust jnug jdst are provided as supplementary and not as final this means that if a stop loss or a target level is reached for any of the additional instruments dgld for instance but not for the main instrument gold in this case we will view positions in both gold and dgld as still open and the stop loss for dgld would have to be moved lower on the other hand if gold moves to a stop loss level but dgld doesn t then we will view both positions in gold and dgld as closed in other words since it s not possible to be 100 certain that each related instrument moves to a given level when the underlying instrument does we can t provide levels that would be binding the levels that we do provide are our best estimate of the levels that will correspond to the levels in the underlying assets but it will be the underlying assets that one will need to focus on regarding the signs pointing to closing a given position or keeping it open we might adjust the levels in the additional instruments without adjusting the levels in the main instruments which will simply mean that we have improved our estimation of these levels not that we changed our outlook on the markets we are already working on a tool that would update these levels on a daily basis for the most popular etfs etns and individual mining stocks our preferred ways to invest in and to trade gold along with the reasoning can be found in the as a reminder gold amp silver trading alerts are posted before or on each trading day we usually post them before the opening bell but we don t promise doing that each day if there s anything urgent we will send you an additional small alert before posting the main one latest free trading alerts on wednesday trump nominated goodfriend to the fed s board of governors what does it mean for the gold market s amp p 500 index lost 0 2 on friday following volatile trading session and a bounce off support level at 2 600 mark is this a topping pattern or just another consolidation within medium term uptrend hand picked

      "text  :  when the graham cassidy bill failed to reach the senate floor last week the media wanted to put a stake in the heart of the administration s agenda declaring all obamacare repeal efforts to be dead for the millions of americans struggling under the affordable care act regime however the fight to make lemonade out of lemons must continue this fall luckily conservatives in congress who want to see the end of obamacare and understand the perils of inaction are not giving up earlier this week america rising squared a conservative policy organization which i lead issued a the first step is to protect them from new obamacare taxes coming in january americans should be encouraged to know that conservatives in the senate have these members of congress understand that obamacare taxes will harm americans of all walks of life and will disproportionately harm seniors and small businesses in all if congress fails to act the health insurance tax would amount to a new annual second there should be no bailouts for obamacare while bipartisanship is a key to success in getting legislation passed the president and conservatives in congress ought to fight back against all efforts to bail out this law when house republicans sued president obama in 2014 over the health care act s cost sharing subsidies a federal judge sided with the plaintiffs deeming these bailouts unconstitutional the obama administration appealed so today president trump can easily drop that appeal and end unconstitutional obamacare cronyism liberals in the senate want new bailouts but conservatives such as cruz have the third step needed to cripple the health care law and protect americans is for president trump to direct the irs to weaken the individual mandate and expand the hardship exemptions the individual mandate has forced many americans to purchase coverage they do not want and cannot afford and even candidate obama the two final steps the president and republicans in congress can take before the end of the year is to fully implement 90 percent cuts to obamacare marketing which would save the federal government some 90 million and fully protect american seniors from new taxes on medicare plans among the taxes going into effect next year those enrolled in medicare advantage and medicare part d will see taxes increased nearly 3 000 each over the next decade if congress fails to act time is running out and president trump and republicans in congress must act now to stop new obamacare taxes end the cronyism of bailouts free americans from burdensome federal mandates cut wasteful aca marketing and protect america s seniors president trump and conservatives have it within their power today to stop the most harmful aspects of the health care law but time is short the time to act is now \n",

      "text  :  in recent months late night talk show host jimmy kimmel has taken to scaremongering his audience with well worn democratic party talking points regarding health care insurance policy between yuks he occasionally accuses republicans of being would be baby killers which is treated as an important political development because well jimmy kimmel is famous this week the comedian was back to explain why the new graham cassidy republican repeal bill is bad news there were only two things wrong with his monologue almost everything he said was either completely untrue or highly misleading and his simplistic emotional appeal was completely disconnected from the real world the comedian s interest in policy was sparked by the harrowing experience of having a newborn son who suffered from a rare health condition thankfully his boy is ok if your baby is going to die and it doesn t have to it shouldn t matter how much money you make said an emotional kimmel in may i think that s something that whether you re a republican or a democrat or something else we all agree on that right yes everyone agrees as far as i know there isn t a single politician in america who has ever supported allowing babies to die because they are born with birth defects even if the parents can t pay not pre obamacare and not post obamacare in any event after kimmel s may rant louisiana sen bill cassidy showed up on his show to explain his position these types of culture encounters shouldn t be dismissed because the fact is most viewers are unaware of specific policies and have a notional understanding that s prejudiced by the establishment media s coverage cassidy came up with something he called the jimmy kimmel test a test that no family should be denied medical care emergency or otherwise because they can t afford it kimmel claims that the new bill doesn t meet this threshold this guy bill cassidy just lied right to my face the talk show host said on tuesday night during an extended political rant he went on to say and by the way before you post a nasty facebook message saying i m politicizing my son s health problems i want you to know i am politicizing my son s health problems ok he explained coverage for all no fact it will kick about 30 million americans off insurance not a single person would be kicked off his or her insurance rather the congressional budget office review of the ahca found that of the 24 million americans who would no longer have health insurance after an obamacare repeal 14 million would choose not to buy insurance in 2018 in the absence of a penalty and if obamacare were not repealed the cbo projects another 6 million people would voluntarily leave the obamacare markets now if you don t believe americans should be afforded the choice to leave or not buy insurance just say that no one is being kicked off moreover if kimmel supports the individual mandate graham cassidy allows california to institute it as i am sure it would kimmel says pre existing conditions nope if the bill passes individual states can let insurance companies charge more if you have a pre existing condition states would be allowed to apply for waivers to change what qualifies as an essential health benefit as long as they still preserve adequate and affordable health insurance coverage for people with pre existing conditions you may prefer price fixing to allowing states flexibility to try and fix these problems but graham cassidy does not break the jimmy kimmel test kimmel might not be aware that there is no plan in place that has government cutting checks after every surgery kimmel then implored his audience to call cassidy to stop the imaginary bill he had just described it s a shame that kimmel didn t provide a number to call for the tens of millions of americans who have seen their premiums and out of pocket costs skyrocket under obamacare s strictures is there no number available for those who are sick of being in exchanges that coerce them to buy plans they don t need that are sold by companies they don t like in fabricated noncompetitive markets with dwindling choices anyway so went a monologue that could have been written by any liberal activist which is to say it was all about cheap zero sum emotionalism kimmel doesn t believe americans deserve the chance to reduce the cost of health care with market based reforms on the state level or in giving states any flexibility in catering their plans to their own citizens kimmel believes california and new york should spend more per capita and smaller states should suffer kimmel doesn t believe that individuals and families should be allowed to contribute to health savings accounts or use them to help pay ever growing insurance premiums kimmel wants average americans to suffer you see anyone can play this game copyright 2017 creators com\n",

      "text  :  days after steven bannon s blustery accusatory interview on 60 minutes in which he warned the apostates blocking president trump s agenda that he s coming after them trump confirmed it there is no such thing as trumpism in recent weeks he s assured democrats he backs legalizing the dreamers affirmed a commitment to foreign aid in front of the united nations and said he s adding troops in afghanistan will trump now accept better terms he wants in the paris climate accord too bad for bannon because none of this is remotely the fault of his favorite punching bags senate minority leader mitch mcconnell and house speaker paul ryan just trump himself bannon s new self described role as wingman growling from outside instead of inside the white house where as chief strategist he fought openly against the globalist forces he believed included trump s family members isn t going very well trump keeps screwing things up for the breitbart news commander after getting fired last month he lamented to the weekly standard that the trump presidency that we fought for and won is over but upon reflection bannon realized that lame duck talk diminishes his own power so he s in overdrive fighting for scraps of a policy vision the president embraces spasmodically bannon says he s enjoying having my hands back on my weapons but he s outside looking in at a west wing filled with elites from goldman sachs the very definition of the swamp that bannon is always frothing about there a president is spending political donations on legal fees while his staffers go deep in debt with mounting lawyer bills visitor logs are kept secret so voters have no idea who is permitted into the oval office to influence the president and a kleptocracy thrives where trump and his children continue to be enriched by business connected to foreign governments including the chinese cabinet secretaries are using government planes for private use and private planes for government work violations that would have sparked endless breitbart bonfires under president obama in reality however there was little left of trumpism to trumpet even before bannon was fired he s got the travel ban or at least a modified version of it and maybe the promised withdrawal from the paris climate agreement bannon will claim credit if trump pulls out of the iran nuclear deal but that s about it on trade and immigration the president has retreated from bannon s barricade crashing proposals and has not withdrawn from nafta not imposed tariffs on chinese steel imports has three times backed off threats over funding for a border wall and now come out in favor of what bannon calls amnesty yet bannon has declared war promising to take out incumbent republican senators who aren t sufficiently loyal to the president targets are guilty of insufficient fealty to trump himself not to an agenda once thought of as trumpism with the backing of loyal mega donor robert mercer the bannon forces are targeting sen jeff flake and potentially sens bob corker and roger wicker as well gop leaders are incensed over the millions more they will spend protecting those lawmakers money that could be spent trying to knock off democrats currently bannon is working to elect roy moore to replace sitting sen luther strange in the alabama senate race trump has endorsed strange also backed by mcconnell bannon is backing the more trumpian candidate and well trump is not bannon ironically purports to be interested in protecting gop majorities in congress before he could imagine trump giving away the store on daca to democratic leaders nancy pelosi and chuck schumer bannon declared in his 60 minutes interview that preserving president obama s executive order would cause a gop civil war he expects dreamers to run out their permits and self deport because amnesty is non negotiable he also said i m worried about losing the house now because of this adding that his fear is in february and march it will be a civil war inside the republican party but if civil war in the gop isn t bannon s aim it s hard to know what is he blames everything on ryan and mcconnell they do not want donald trump s populist economic agenda to be implemented it s very obvious it s obvious as night follows day he told charlie rose in the name of trumpism bannon swallows heavy doses of denial after all when trump threatened to withdraw from nafta the president s kids and other aides made calls to the canadian government and arranged for prime minister justin trudeau to call trump and talk him off the ledge it wasn t ryan or mcconnell trump s approval ratings remain low bannon said because he hasn t we haven t gotten the wall built earth to steve trump has signaled to congress the wall is a joke in the wake of the daca debacle breitbart called the president amnesty don yet bannon himself has stayed sheepishly silent ann coulter author of in trump we trust tweeted looks like bannon got it wrong that shadowy force trying to nullify the 2016 election is sam nunberg a close bannonite conceded the reality is sinking in that the trump administration is on the precipice of turning into an establishment presidency but bannon isn t just breaking plates at breitbart he s building his own brand last week like any other dime a dozen elitist bannon attended an investor conference in hong kong he told the exclusive gathering he speaks to trump every two to three days despite white house denials that the president has spoken more than once with bannon since he left before trump disappointed him on daca nunberg had hailed bannon s increased influence with trump i think steve leaves and a week later he trump pardons arpaio and they suspend daca i don t think there was any coincidence there nunberg told buzzfeed bannon remains fixated on the threat china poses to the united states has grimly predicted we will be at war with that nation within five to 10 years over its buildup of military installations in the south china sea and said we re already at economic war with china yet his domestic bark in this regard doesn t seem to be the same as his overseas investor conference bite once there the new york times described bannon as more subdued about the purported chinese threat the wall street journal reported he described trump s great respect for president xi and prospects for trade but that the u s needs to play a stronger role in changing the system in china an attendee recalled it s a far cry from a trade war on steel perhaps over time bannonism will go the way of trumpism a b stoddard is associate editor of realclearpolitics and a columnist she is also host of no labels radio on sirius xm s potus channel \n"
